This course has provided a comprehensive foundation for my transition into the IT sector, enabling me to develop essential competencies in hardware systems, networking infrastructure, operating systems, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

Through practical workshops and industry-relevant scenarios, I acquired hands-on experience in contemporary IT environments, including cloud computing architectures and Internet of Things (IoT) implementations. This training has strengthened both my technical capabilities and my aptitude for effective communication and user support delivery.

I have developed proficiency in smart technology deployment, IoT integration, and network configuration for both residential and commercial environments, utilising Cisco Packet Tracer as my primary simulation tool. My networking studies encompassed comprehensive coverage of IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, routing fundamentals, and core cybersecurity principles.

Additionally, I gained practical experience with electrical circuit analysis through EveryCircuit simulations and developed competence in interpreting and producing technical schematics. My technical skill set extends to Cisco IOS command-line interface operations, virtualisation technologies, and cloud computing platforms.

Beyond technical proficiencies, I have cultivated an understanding of project management methodologies, including Agile and Waterfall frameworks. I am experienced in utilising collaborative tools such as Trello, Gantt charts, and Kanban boards for project planning and documentation purposes.

This programme has equipped me with structured problem-solving methodologies and critical thinking approaches essential for addressing IT challenges systematically. I am now well-prepared for entry-level IT positions and relevant industry certifications, with a commitment to continuous professional development to remain current with evolving technological landscapes.

The completion of this programme has provided me with not only technical expertise but also the professional confidence and adaptability required to succeed in the IT industry.
