This course has been a valuable learning experience, enabling me to significantly enhance my skills in hardware, networking, operating systems, and cybersecurity.

Through interactive workshops and real-world scenarios, I gained practical experience. I learned to navigate modern IT environments, including cloud computing and the Internet of Things, while also honing my communication and user support capabilities.

Through my experiences, I've gained practical skills in setting up smart technologies, integrating IoT, and configuring home and office networks, all achieved using Cisco Packet Tracer.

My studies also allowed me to develop a strong understanding of IPv4 and IPv6, mastering routing protocols and learning the fundamentals of cybersecurity practices.

I gained hands-on experience with electrical principles and circuit simulations using EveryCircuit. In addition to my technical skills, I am now quite confident in reading and creating technical schematics. 

I am also skilled at working with Cisco IOS CLI, as well as understanding virtualisation and cloud technologies.

Beyond honing technical skills, I've expanded my understanding of Agile and Waterfall project management methodologies. I've also gained practical experience using tools such as Trello, Gantt charts, and Kanban boards for effective planning and documentation.

More importantly, I now face IT challenges with structured problem-solving skills and critical thinking. I am prepared for entry-level IT roles and certifications, and I am dedicated to lifelong learning to keep pace with the industry.
Having completed this program, I find myself equipped not just with technical skills but also with the confidence and adaptability needed to thrive as an IT professional.
